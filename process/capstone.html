            <strong>Elevator Pitch :</strong><br>
            I want to help artists modulate their vocals live with 
            a hands-free pedal, that adds to the experience of the 
            performance

    <h3> Week Two Assignment (01/23) </h3>
    <p id="week-two">Ana Mahadevan<br> </p>

    <p> <strong>Week Two Critique</strong><br> 
        I spoke to Zack this week about feeling 
        a bit nebulous 
    </p>

    <p> <strong>Progress</strong><br>
        Prior to class this week I had only set up a breadboard 
        that turns the Daisy Electrosmith on and off, However after
        I felt inspired and approached a new plan for what I wanted
        to build. It's a big move (kind of) from my last plan so I was 
        feeling a bit nervous.

        <img src="/process/cap-assets/cap2.jpg" alt="">
    </ul>

    <p> <strong>Week Three Plan</strong><br>
        This coming week I would like to start my user testing and get
        some feedback on where buttons should be and designs that make 
        sense in live performance!

        <p> <strong> Usability interviews : <br>  </strong>  </p>
        <p> Filip Casey (Lead singer of telecine) <br>
            Initial thoughts without seeing product: <br>
            Said he would personally look for a delay feature first, he wants to
            be able to change delay and decay time. <br>
            - bit crush<br>
            - hard clipping distortion <br>
            - no reverb , because room is non treated <br>
            - freeze<br>

            After being show design iteration 1 and 2:<br>
            Likes orb design more, says that appearance is also part of the performance 

        </p>
        <p> Zade Baldwin ( Vocalist , guitar player, my drummer ) <br>
            Initial thoughts without seeing product: <br>
            Wants digital effects that wouldn't be available from basic 
            analog pedals he could pre-amp <br>
            - pitch correction<br>
            - reverb <br>
            - delay <br>
            - distortion <br>

            After being show design iteration 1 and 2:<br>
            Doesn't care what it looks like as long as it works, worries orb might be too top heavy if kicked over ?

        <p >Ana Mahadevan<br> </p><br>
         
        week four progress...<br>

        well, i've basically realized i just have to do this, wiring the input and output

        <ul>
            <img src="/process/cap-assets/planofattack.PNG" alt="">
        </ul>

        seems easy enough right? so i can build a simple circuit with input and output
        ( the wiring here connects to different dial potentiometers )
        <ul>
            <img src="/process/cap-assets/boywhatthehell.jpg" alt="">
        </ul>

        but obviously the issue is everything in between, and also the issues i havent thought of yet <br>

        <ul>new issues to tweak about ( obstacles as you would call them )<br>
            dealing with power management ? <br>
            input output jacks <br>
            specific kinds of dials? can i make my own? <br>
        </ul>

        <h3> Mentor Feedback : Wayne Seltzer </h3>
           Think about what makes this different, WHY are you making this<br>
            If you care about aesthetics, then you should lean into to the live performance aspect of the product </li>
            Digital or analog ? <br>
            Narrow scope, creating effects is much more difficult than you might think<br>
             Pitch correction is probably going to be extremely difficult and not worth pursuing <br>

        Think about what code you want to put onto your seed, this should be based on the specific vocal effects you want and what program makes them the easiest to code <br>
        Daisy documentation based on language here <br>
        Think about inputs and outputs that go into a bread board <br>

        <h3> UX Testing 2 </h3>

        So I finally ended up opting to switch hardware to the DaisyPod, just so I can at the bare minimum easily test 
        <br> difference in vocal softwares.

        <h3> Week Six Assignment (02/20) </h3>
        <p >Ana Mahadevan<br> </p><br>

        There comes a point in a project where you realize the way that you've stubbornly been going down is wrong,<br>
        and that you won't be able to complete things unless you pivot. And, finally accept that you have to let go of
        <br> your preconceptions and try something different.<br> <br>
        That's where I hit earlier this week, after a long difficult conversation with one of my mentors. <br>
        Now, i'm moving on to using a slightly different interface with a different chip that should at the very least 
        <br>allow me to easily prototype the actual software which controls the function of what i'm trying to do 
        without having to worry about faulty wiring <br> Now i've been focusing on solely software , the daisy pod is actually
        running audio which feels like a huge step but ultimately one that I should have made weeks earlier. 

        <br>
        I'm trying to keep myself accountable now, by setting more specific goals for days and overall weeks.

        Issues, Issues, Issues.
        <br> <br>
        Software: <br>
        Can't seem to figure out memory wise where the code is leaking. I'm planning to go line by line and breakpoint everything, <br>but
        at the current moment I have to reflash code onto the chip everytime I reconnect it to power. Not good<br><br>

        Hardware: <br>
        Everything is functional from a hardware standpoint, but I have come upon the realization that I'm going to have to move off of my breakout board (daisy pod)<br>,
        its too fragile to be stepped on and the pots cant just be pushed off the board.

        Moving off the breakout board... It's serious now

        This is the plan that we discussed in class fleshed out, <br>
         I'm also considering moving off onto a breadboard, so I dont have
         to solder directly onto the pins.

        <br>
        Wires look messy, you need to make a plan to keep things clean<br>
       Plan:  switching off protoboard entirely, wiring everything into <br>
