        <p>
            <strong>Elevator Pitch :</strong><br>
            I want to help artists modulate their vocals live with 
            a hands-free pedal, that adds to the experience of the 
            performance 
    
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Iteration 2 mark (week 7) Low- Fidelity Prototype</strong><br>
                <br>- UX Testing, implement feedback on positioning and features into planning</li>
                <br>- Find mentors, get feedback and implement</li>
                <br>- Make a basic circuit build: <ul>
                        - daisy seed turns onable to modulate <br>
                        - can take in and put out sound 
                    </ul>
                <li>Stretch goal: Begin enclosure design & making character art
        </p><br>

            <br>- CAD design
            <br>- Circuits in enclosure

    <h3> Week Two Assignment (01/23) </h3>

    <p> <strong>Week Two Critique</strong><br> 
        I spoke to Zack this week about feeling 
        a bit nebulous 
    </p>

    <p> <strong>Progress</strong><br>
        Prior to class this week I had only set up a breadboard 
        that turns the Daisy Electrosmith on and off, However after
        I felt inspired and approached a new plan for what I wanted
        to build. It's a big move (kind of) from my last plan so I was 
        feeling a bit nervous.

    </ul>

    <p> <strong>Week Three Plan</strong><br>
        This coming week I would like to start my user testing and get
        some feedback on where buttons should be and designs that make 
        sense in live performance!

        <p> <strong> Starting deliverables :</strong><br></p>
        <p> making sure the daisy can turn on, and produce sound  </p>

        <h3> Week Four Assignment (02/06) </h3>
        <h4>Week three progress (on UX Testing): <br></h4>
        <p> <strong> Usability interviews : <br>  </strong>  </p>
        <p> Filip Casey (Lead singer of telecine) <br>
            Initial thoughts without seeing product: <br>
            Said he would personally look for a delay feature first, he wants to
            be able to change delay and decay time. <br>
            - bit crush<br>
            - hard clipping distortion <br>
            - no reverb , because room is non treated <br>
            - freeze<br>
        </p>
        <p> Zade Baldwin ( Vocalist , guitar player, my drummer ) <br>
            Initial thoughts without seeing product: <br>
            Wants digital effects that wouldn't be available from basic 
            analog pedals he could pre-amp <br>
            - pitch correction<br>
            - reverb <br>
            - delay <br>
            - distortion <br>
        </p>

        <h4> User scenarios/use cases/personas:   </h4>
        <p> Artists within different genre performances, 
        shifts in music with punk vs shoegaze vs indie artists </p>
