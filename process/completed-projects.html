          <p><strong>Vision :</strong>
            My cat, BMO, eats my plants and socks. I decided to try to solve
            this problem by keeping her entertained elsewhere, and redirecting
            her attention. A toy has never managed to survive BMOâ€™s grasps, so 
            I knew it would have to be a laser.

         </ul>
          <p>
            <strong> First Iteration:</strong> 
            I wanted the toy to turn on when the object detected her in front of it
            and I realized I would need a sensor of some kind. As I was researching
             sonic detection versus PIR I found out that sonic sensors have trouble seeing 
             cats because of their fur. Although the PIR sensor seemed like the obvious
            choice, it presented it's own set of issues due to it being quite a finicky 
            piece of hardware.

          </ul>

          <p> When trying to decide how to project the laser out onto the 
            floor I ended up opting to make a turret like design with a PIR
            sensor at the front perpendicular a my servo motor with the laser 
            taped to it.

            <strong> Issues:</strong> 
           This was my first time woodworking, and soldering so there was a 
           lot of mistakes to be made and a lot to be learned. On the software
           side of things, coding the motor, laser, and sensor to work
           in unsion together was a bit of a struggle. Ultimately my biggest
           issue with my design was how top heavy the tower was, it was easy for
           my little gremlin to knock it over and effectively pull out all of the wires
           from the arduino

          <p>
            <strong> Second Iteration:</strong> 
            In my second take, in designing the enclosure there were a couple 
            critiques I wanted to address. Mainly, the stability and having
            better protection for the actual laser from the cat who might try 
            to eat it. This was a bit more difficult so I switched up my enclosure.

          </ul>

          <p>
            I hacked a laser I had found at the thrift store and decided to keep the 
            motor and the actual light. 
            
            It used 
            the enclosure and used a mirror to reflect it out to the cat. In terms of coding, DC1 was relatively simple: the code just connected the laser to a servo and made it move in certain angles. Since I upgraded to a DC motor in DC2 it was a great opportunity to make things more interactive for the cat. Now, the rotation changes and is random as the cat plays more ( using the random() function!! ). The new motor also enables more motion (around and up and down). I feel a lot better with the final product, but as I went through the redesigning process there was so many things I wish I had extra time / resources to re-do.
