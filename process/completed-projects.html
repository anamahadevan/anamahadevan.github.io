          <p><strong>Vision :</strong>
            My cat, BMO, eats my plants and socks. I decided to try to solve
            this problem by keeping her entertained elsewhere, and redirecting
            her attention. A toy has never managed to survive BMOâ€™s grasps, so 
            I knew it would have to be a laser.

         </ul>
          <p>
            <strong> First Process Note:</strong> 
            During the first iteration I made a little tower with a laser on a
            servo motor that would move when she came in front of my PIR sensor.
             I chose to use PIR, because as I was researching sonic detection I
             found out they have trouble seeing cats. This ending up being a 
             questionable choice though because it is a quite finicky piece of 
             hardware (here).

            <strong>Issues:</strong> 
           Pretty immediately I have come to the problem of spacing and placement, 
           when I tried to implement a gallery wall I had seen documentation for it 
           completely broke the spacing of everything else.

          <strong> First Process Note:</strong> 
          When I began to create my portal I wanted to make sure I was hand coding every function
         that I had planned in the previous milestone, without following any other code. This ended 
         up helping me, as since the javascript I wrote was just a simpler version for my needs I 
         was able to significantly reduce the amount of code I needed. <br><br>

       </ul>
        <strong>Process Note Two:</strong>
         As mentioned in Milestone One, I really want to focus on the movement and 
          aesthetics of the site, but I do need for the assignments to be navigable. 
          I have been debating whether I should do entries in my process blog that link to arbitrary 
          areas of my class portal, or to implement anything for my overall portfolio. 
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><img src="/process/front-assets/.jpg" alt=""></li>
        </ul>

        
        Documentation in your process blog of the process you went through creating your portal.
        Describe any problems or roadblocks you encountered and how you resolved them. 
        Talk about any lessons learned of what worked and what you'd do differently next time.
         And don't forget to link to any out-of-class resources that you used to help create
          the portal.

        <p>
          <strong>Issues:</strong> 
         As I actually begin to code my class portal and flesh things out, I am struggling to
         create in css and html what I plan in Figma and on paper. Positioning and having foresight
         to know what to code first / layer where has been challenging
