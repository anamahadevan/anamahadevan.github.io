          <p><strong>Vision :</strong>
            There are a couple tenants that I want to adhere as part of
            my current plan for my class portal / portfolio website. The
            first thing is that I really want to focus on the movement and 
            flow of the site, I wanted it to kind of feel like seamlessly 
            flipping through a magazine without using literal page flipping 
            animations. The second is that the site must be responsive for all
             screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.

            <li><img src="/process/front-assets/inspo.png" alt=""></li>
         </ul>
          <p>
            <strong> First Process Note:</strong> 
            The first thing I decided in the design process was that I wanted to
            use a horizontal scroll. This meant that I needed to create a container
            which the content was in, then rotate its child elements 90 degrees
             backwards to counter the container's rotation so that when I scrolled down 
             the screen would move to the right. 
          </p>

            <li><img src="/process/front-assets/mile1a.jpg" alt=""></li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <strong>Issues:</strong> 
           Pretty immediately I have come to the problem of spacing and placement, 
           when I tried to implement a gallery wall I had seen documentation for it 
           completely broke the spacing of everything else. 
         </p>

            <strong>Plan:</strong> 
           Below are sketches that lay out what I plan to attempt to code

          <strong> First Process Note:</strong> 
          When I began to create my portal I wanted to make sure I was hand coding every function
         that I had planned in the previous milestone, without following any other code. This ended 
         up helping me, as since the javascript I wrote was just a simpler version for my needs I 
         was able to significantly reduce the amount of code I needed. <br><br>
         <ul>
          <li><img src="/process/front-assets/.png" alt=""></li>
       </ul>
        <strong>Process Note Two:</strong>
         As mentioned in Milestone One, I really want to focus on the movement and 
          aesthetics of the site, but I do need for the assignments to be navigable. 
          I have been debating whether I should do entries in my process blog that link to arbitrary 
          areas of my class portal, or to implement anything for my overall portfolio. 
        </p>

          <li><img src="/process/front-assets/.jpg" alt=""></li>
        </ul>

        
        Documentation in your process blog of the process you went through creating your portal.
        Describe any problems or roadblocks you encountered and how you resolved them. 
        Talk about any lessons learned of what worked and what you'd do differently next time.
         And don't forget to link to any out-of-class resources that you used to help create
          the portal.

        <p>
          <strong>Issues:</strong> 
         As I actually begin to code my class portal and flesh things out, I am struggling to
         create in css and html what I plan in Figma and on paper. Positioning and having foresight
         to know what to code first / layer where has been challenging
