          <h3> Milestone One </h3>

          <p><strong>Vision :</strong>
            There are a couple tenants that I want to adhere as part of
            my current plan for my class portal / portfolio website. The
            first thing is that I really want to focus on the movement and 
            flow of the site, I wanted it to kind of feel like seamlessly 
            flipping through a magazine without using literal page flipping 
            animations. The second is that the site must be responsive for all
             screen sizes, from mobile to desktop. 
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><img src="/process/front-assets/inspo.png" alt=""></li>
         </ul>
          <p>
            <strong> First Process Note:</strong> 
            The first thing I decided in the design process was that I wanted to
            use a horizontal scroll. This meant that I needed to create a container
            which the content was in, then rotate its child elements 90 degrees
             backwards to counter the container's rotation so that when I scrolled down 
             the screen would move to the right. 
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><img src="/process/front-assets/mile1a.jpg" alt=""></li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <strong>Issues:</strong> 
           Pretty immediately I have come to the problem of spacing and placement, 
           when I tried to implement a gallery wall I had seen documentation for it 
           completely broke the spacing of everything else. 
         </p>

            <strong>Plan:</strong> 
           Below are sketches that lay out what I plan to attempt to code
