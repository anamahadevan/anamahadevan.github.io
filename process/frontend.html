          <h3 id = "mile-one"> Milestone One </h3>

          <p><strong>Vision :</strong>
            There are a couple tenants that I want to adhere as part of
            my current plan for my class portal / portfolio website. The
            first thing is that I really want to focus on the movement and 
            flow of the site, I wanted it to kind of feel like seamlessly 
            flipping through a magazine without using literal page flipping 
            animations. The second is that the site must be responsive for all
             screen sizes, from mobile to desktop. 
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><img src="/process/front-assets/inspo.png" alt=""></li>
         </ul>
          <p>
            <strong> First Process Note:</strong> 
            The first thing I decided in the design process was that I wanted to
            use a horizontal scroll. This meant that I needed to create a container
            which the content was in, then rotate its child elements 90 degrees
             backwards to counter the container's rotation so that when I scrolled down 
             the screen would move to the right. 
          </p>

            <li><img src="/process/front-assets/mile1a.jpg" alt=""></li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <strong>Issues:</strong> 
           Pretty immediately I have come to the problem of spacing and placement, 
           when I tried to implement a gallery wall I had seen documentation for it 
           completely broke the spacing of everything else. 
         </p>
         <p>
            <strong>Plan:</strong> 
           Below are sketches that lay out what I plan to attempt to code

         As mentioned in Milestone One, I really want to focus on the movement and

        Overall description of the project:
        The topic/purpose of the website
        Your inspiration for the project
        The intended audience for your project
        Wireframe that shows the design and flow of your site. This could be anywhere from hand drawn sequence of images to a low-fidelity mockup in a UX design tool of you choice.
        Description of how you intend to use JavaScript to significantly enhance the user experience of your website.
        Description of which new-to-you JavaScript library or 3rd party API you intend to you, and what you intend to use it for.
        Any content or information sources you intend to draw upon, start thinking about them early and include them in the proposal if possible.
        Describe or show how you intend to make the website responsive to different screen sizes and environments.
        Your goals for the project should be split up by what you think are goals for:
        Prototyping/proof of concept
        MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
        Stretch goals

      <p>
        <strong> Creative Approach:</strong> 
        I wanted to follow suite from some of the sites from the early 2000s , 
        very much so decoden my space core.
        <br>
       <ul>

     </ul>
      <strong>Technical Approach:</strong>
       One of the difficult things about these kinds of websites is they have a
      lot of different windows with different functions entirely. I chose to start
      by trying to code and recreate the basic framework of the page
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong> Intended Goals:</strong>
        The goal for this project was very different than what I ended up doing ( evidently )
        So when I decided to pivot mid project, I didn't have a super high bar for what I believed
        to be achievable in the time that was left. I wanted to at least get the framework down so it
        was visually cohesive.

      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong> Reflection:</strong>
        Considering that I changed my entire plans last minute and decided to rework all of my code, I feel like things
        went a lot better than expected. I wish that I had been able to complete more in the time I had, and have the 
        site be more fleshed out and a better reflection of what those kind of sites looked like back in the day.
