    </ul>

    I wanted all of the prints that I made for my independent study to 
    be things I either hand drew, or digitally composed. I spent a couple
    weeks making lots of different designs for different purposes. At some
    point I realized I needed to shift towards designs that could be easily 
    printed or stamped.

    <h3 id = "#wood"> printing on wood : </h3>

    I actually didn't plan to do this initially, but wanted to test the capabilities
    of our laser cutter in the lab so I could eventually make layered paper posters or 
    stamps to make prints. In my first round of tests the image in photoshop then bringing it into rhino

    <ul>
        <li><img src="/process/is23-assets/rhino.png" alt=""></li>
        <li><img src="/process/is23-assets/sappho.jpg" alt=""></li>
    </ul>

    Initially I had tried making only vector images in Illustrator, but the laser cutter 
    actually did a great job of reading pngs
    <ul>
        <li><img src="/process/is23-assets/laser.MOV" alt=""></li>
    </ul>

    I printed on a couple different items at a few different sizes. My final print took about 
    an hour on the machine to complete .

    <ul>
        <li><img src="/process/is23-assets/wood1.jpg" alt=""></li>
        <li><img src="/process/is23-assets/wood2.jpg" alt=""></li>
    </ul>

    <h3> " of sappho: " </h3>
    This piece is based on a poem by Sappho, one of the first recognized queer poets in writers
    from ancient Greece. The term sapphic comes from her name, and the word lesbian comes from 
    the island she lived on, Lesbos.

    <h3 id = "#block"> block prints: </h3>

    This was by far my favorite printing method, I started by laser cutting rubber pieces
    multiple times over with the same design to get some depth and some variation

    <ul>
        <li><img src="/process/is23-assets/block1.jpg" alt=""></li>
        <li><img src="/process/is23-assets/block2.jpg" alt=""></li>

    </ul>
    My first stamp that worked!  Printed on cardstock using archive ink, to test for what was 
    about to happen... I actually ended up liking this method and would come to adopt it later on.

    <h3 id = "#poster"> printing on fabric: </h3>

    This was part of my home decor plan, that I had layed out in my initial document
    when we were planning out the independent study. A novel idea sure, but in reality
    I think I might need to do some more research on fabrics and inks and what is best 
    suited for what.

    <h3 id = "#band"> making band prints + shirts: </h3>

    It was at this point I realized that I could use the methods that I had previously been
    playing with to make something I had been needing-- band merch! We had been wanting to 
    make tshirts and potentially other items so I set off to it.

    <ul>
        <li><img src="/process/is23-assets/band1.jpg" alt=""></li>
        <li><img src="/process/is23-assets/band2.jpg" alt=""></li>
    </ul>

    I hand drew a picture for the stamp, then made an image on photoshop, flipped it and 
    cut it into another one of my rubber blocks.

    <ul>
        <li><img src="/process/is23-assets/band3.jpg" alt=""></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <strong> the experience:</strong> <br><br>
      This experience has been so much more than just an academic endeavor; 
      it's genuinely become a passion that I'm excited to continue growing.I'm so grateful I was given the time 
      and the space to do this project. I wasn't really sure what it would look like when I started, 
      and had started to feel nervous because I wasn't able to access many of the different equipment 
      I had initially planned. but, I think because I used what was around me in abundance I was actually 
      able to have way more flexibility and time to experiment, mess up and make things I really liked. 

      <br><br><br><strong> moving forward:</strong> <br><br>
      I plan on continuing the work that I've been doing in my independent study into 
      the next semester and even beyond that. The process has been incredibly rewarding
       and enjoyable for me. Creating and experimenting with new ideas was a significant 
       learning journey. I want to keep exploring the limits of what I can do, and how much
    further I can push my creativity and technical skills. Every print has been a step, and
     I feel like I've just caught my stride. There's so much more I want to learn!
