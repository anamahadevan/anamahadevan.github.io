          <p>Ana Mahadevan<br> Making a Book Loom</p>
          <p><strong>Vision :</strong>
            I got these new yarns, paper and fern silk and things,
            and I am wondering what to make with them. I’m thinking
            something to do with sound and texture. Since I had 
            some left over warp on the loom, I stared by just 
            playing with the paper yarns and seeing how they pack 
            and shape and then choosing my next step from there.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Process Note 1 :</strong> 
            The paper seems to pack and expand to whatever space 
            its given. Specifically, in a tight weave it packs down. 
            I chose to weave it with a basket weave structure just to 
            give it a little more room. I then expanded out to larger 
            basket weaves to see how it might “bloom” and then also 
            doubled up the passes to make the rows a bit thicker.

          <p><strong>Process Note 2:</strong> With the idea that I should make it a more official piece, I decided to bind the bottom edge of the textile while its on the loom. I have applied a similar technique after weaving, but during weaving seemed to be a bit easier and I wanted to see how it might work. It took me a while to figure out the process, but then I found a technique that worked: see below:</p>
          <p><img src="/images/img_8811.jpg" alt="insert tapestry needle under first weft row and 4 warps. "></p>
          <p><img src="/images/img_8812.jpg" alt="pull that yarn through"></p>
          <p><img src="/images/img_8813.jpg" alt="loop backward (towards perviously bound yarns), and then come UNDER the four yarns below the first weft row, and OVER the back of the binding yarn"></p>
          <p><img src="/images/img_8814.jpg" alt="Then, repeat, by selecting the next four warps above the first weft row. "></p>
          <p><img src="/images/img_8817.jpg" alt="and tighten the loop down. "></p>
          <p><img src="/images/img_8829.jpg" alt="view of finished binding row, looks a bit separated by first warp row, might be fixed by selecting yarns about 3-4 rows up in stead of one. "></p>
          <p><strong>Process Note 3:</strong> Taking a step back and reflecting, I began to see the loopy ends of the paper being the most interesting. In the next steps, I played with this more:</p>
          <p><img src="/images/img_8849.jpg" alt=""></p>
          <p>At first, I though I would create patterns by interlacing the loops and allowing them to travel in different directions.</p>
          <p><img src="/images/img_8855.jpg" alt=""></p>
          <p>I then realized that the contrast between the looping paper and the brown warps created the most visual interest and I wanted to emphasize that by having more open regions of the brown.</p>
          <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> The ideas I explored didn’t lead to any magical insights, but I did find that the paper might work best when integrated into tapestry, as a kind of texture. I also enjoyed the sound of working with the paper, making me want to explore how it could be designed to produce sounds more intentionally, like associated with particular movements. Maybe an integrated speaker might further amplify the sound.</p>
