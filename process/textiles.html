          <h3> Making a Book Loom </h3>
          <p>Ana Mahadevan<br> Week One </p>

          <p><strong>Vision :</strong>
            I got these new yarns, paper and fern silk and things,
            and I am wondering what to make with them. I’m thinking
            something to do with sound and texture. Since I had 
            some left over warp on the loom, I stared by just 
            playing with the paper yarns and seeing how they pack 
            and shape and then choosing my next step from there.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Process Note 1 :</strong> 
            I realized pretty quickly that the string for the warp 
            needed to be pretty tight or it wouldn't create enough
            tension to lift the alternating strings.  
            give it a little more room. 
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/w1a.jpg" alt=""></li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <strong>Process Note 2:</strong> 
           Set up was initially relatively painless. After a couple
           times rethreading the string harness, I was to create a clean 
           weave and pull through the semi conductive thread.

          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Process Note 3:</strong>
            This is where things start to go sideways... I decided I want to try to make 
            the design look like the eye that's on the cover of the book. It seemed like a 
            novel idea initially, but not being able to use the string harness for lines pulled 
            entire weave tighter than I wanted. Seemingly for nothing too, as the design wasn't 
            especially evident.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/w1c.jpg" alt=""></li>
            <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/w1d.jpg" alt=""></li>
          </ul>
          <p> 
            Here is the finished swatch, after doing some hand-weaving everything was a
            a bit tighter and not as even. So, even when using the basket weave or just 
            the string harness itself towards the end it was still messy.
          </p>
            <p class = "fullsize"><img src="/process/ext-assets/w1final.jpg" alt=""></p>
          
            <strong>Reflection :</strong>
             This was my first time ever weaving anything! I had a lot of fun, but even 
             as I was going through there was so many mistakes I noticed and was very tempted to
             (and occasionally did) completely unravel.
