          <h3> Making a Book Loom </h3>
          <p id="week-one">Ana Mahadevan<br> Week One </p>

          <p><strong>Vision :</strong>
            I wanted to have my weave kind of match/coincide with the book 
            I was using as my loom, not just aesthetically but also with the
            themes within the story. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Process Note 1 :</strong> 
            I realized pretty quickly that the string for the warp 
            needed to be pretty tight or it wouldn't create enough
            tension to lift the alternating strings.  
            give it a little more room. 
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/w1a.jpg" alt=""></li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <strong>Process Note 2:</strong> 
           Set up was initially relatively painless. After a couple
           times rethreading the string harness, I was to create a clean 
           weave and pull through the semi conductive thread. 
            </p>
          <ul>
            <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/w1b.jpg" alt=""></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Process Note 3:</strong>
            This is where things start to go sideways... I decided I want to try to make 
            the design look like the eye that's on the cover of the book. It seemed like a 
            novel idea initially, but not being able to use the string harness for lines pulled 
            entire weave tighter than I wanted. Seemingly for nothing too, as the design wasn't 
            especially evident.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/w1c.jpg" alt=""></li>
            <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/w1d.jpg" alt=""></li>
          </ul>
          <p> 
            Here is the finished swatch, after doing some hand-weaving everything was a
            a bit tighter and not as even. So, even when using the basket weave or just 
            the string harness itself towards the end it was still messy.
          </p>

            <strong>Reflection :</strong>
             This was my first time ever weaving anything! I had a lot of fun, but even 
             as I was going through there was so many mistakes I noticed and was very tempted to
             (and occasionally did) completely unravel.

        <h3> Using the Cricket Loom </h3>
        <p id="week-two">Ana Mahadevan<br> Week Two </p>

        <p><strong>Vision :</strong>
          This week, my friend and I went on a thrifting binge
          looking for weird and interesting yarns. My plan here was
          not to make anything cohesive per say but to accomplish  
          the basics with the cricket loom, and experiment with different
          techniques and materials.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Process Note 1 :</strong> 
          The set up itself was honestly the most difficult part of this whole
          project. The precision and care that it takes just to thread the heddles
          and wind onto the warp beam was extensive. 
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/w3a.jpg" alt=""></li>
          <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/w3b.jpg" alt=""></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Process Note 2:</strong> 
         I wanted my first swatch to be a way for me to get used to
         the loom, so I experimented with how the swatch looked 
         based on how hard I would beat the wefts. You can see the variations.
          </p>
        <ul>
          <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/w3c.jpg" alt=""></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Process Note 3:</strong>
          For my next swatch, I was inspired by the area I was sitting in 
          outside with my cat. Using yarn I found that is used to 
          make sponges and dish rags, the texture and strength of the yarn
          pulled inmy warp a bit and I think ultimately made the swatches 
          different sizes. To make the clouds, I came in from the sides and 
          wove in the yarn I was using to make the headers. The contrast
          of the pokey blue threads with the soft white was very pleasing to me.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/w3d.jpg" alt=""></li>
          <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/w3e.jpg" alt=""></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Process Note 4:</strong>
          In my final swatch, I wanted to switch the methods with which
          I was weaving with. So I hand wove every other on some on the bottom
          shed, then switched for the reverse shed.
        </p>
        <p class = "fullsize"><img src="/process/ext-assets/w3f.jpg" alt=""></p>
        <p> 
          Here are the finished swatches ! Stitched off on either end to keep the 
          whole thing from unraveling
        </p>
          <p class = "fullsize"><img src="/process/ext-assets/w3final.jpg" alt=""></p>
        
          <strong>Reflection :</strong>
           I really enjoyed using the cricket loom this time. It was so much easier to 
           keep things in place and for the most part keep even tension. I do need to 
           make sure next time not to pull in the warp as much.

      <h3> Making Connectors </h3>
      <p id="week-three">Ana Mahadevan<br> Week Three </p>

      <p><strong>Vision :</strong>
        I picked up some pretty beads from the art store, and wanted to make some
        connectors that were aesthetically pleasing but still conductive and would
        be able to be somewhat modular 

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Process Note 1 :</strong> 
        I had a lot of fun making the normal kinds of connectors!
        The first one took quite a bit but after that I got into 
        a flow of sorts and it was much faster to finish the rest.
        It was a bit of a pain getting the shrink wraps over the right parts of 
        the cords and getting them to shrink down to the size they needed to be
        to fit. 
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/w2a.jpg" alt=""></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>Process Note 2:</strong> 
       I started by trying to make a more rigid connector, I twisted three strands of a 
       copper wire to weave through some of the beads but had to only thread the middle
       string for the beads which holes were smaller. I was worried this would destroy how
       conductive the connector would be but it didnt!!
        </p>
      <ul>
        <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/w2b.jpg" alt=""></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Process Note 3:</strong>
        The second connector I made requires some tension to be conductivem
        because it is less rigid. I chose to use a bra hook to connect the 
        two seperate pieces, which worked much better than I anticipated after
        some fiddling with my pliers.

      </ul>
      
        <strong>Reflection :</strong>
         I really liked making these, and it was really intersting to
         see what different factors would change the resistance of each
         connector. I would be curious to see the actual practical 
         application of these two.

    <h3> Making A One-Bit Flipping Bead </h3>
    <p id="week-four">Ana Mahadevan<br> Week Four </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Process Note 1 :</strong> 
      I was really excited to do any kind of circuit work even if it was incredibly simple. 
      I didn't want to complicate things too much so I made two pretty simple different swatches. 
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/" alt=""></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <strong>Process Note 2:</strong> 
      I wish I had thought to have a way to stick the copper wire out on two different sides in a 
      stronger way while I was weaving. I didn't realize until I was trying to put my connecters on
      the string that it made a very weak connection and therefore harder for the bead to flip.
      </p>
    <ul>
      <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/" alt=""></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Process Note 3:</strong>
      The first time we tried to flip the bead, it started to smoke, which of course was cause for 
      concern. I also feel like if I had sewn the bead in a little looser it would perhaps be able 
      to flip with less power needed and therefore not short when it was connected to batteries
    </p>

      <!-- <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/w1c.jpg" alt=""></li> -->
      <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/" alt=""></li>
    </ul>
    
      <strong>Reflection :</strong>
       I had a lot of fun! I'm thinking about doing something like this again soon, 
       with the knowledge I picked up from the mistakes I made this go around.

  <h3> Making A One-Bit Flipping Bead </h3>
  <p id="week-five">Ana Mahadevan<br> Week Five </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Process Note 1 :</strong> 
    I started by applying thermochromic heat in two different ways. First I tied
    white string around a paper plate, then painted different strings different colors. Then for the 
    second swatch I painted the warp itself. I was curious to see what would make more of a difference
    
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/" alt=""></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>Process Note 2:</strong> 
   What I didnt realize, was that the thermochromic paint was going to be very
   sticky and stiff. This made weaving the coated string really difficult, but
   strangely worked perfectly for the warp.
