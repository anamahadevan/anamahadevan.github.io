          <h3> Making a Book Loom </h3>
          <p id="week-one">Ana Mahadevan<br> Week One </p>

          <p><strong>Vision :</strong>
            I wanted to have my weave kind of match/coincide with the book 
            I was using as my loom, not just aesthetically but also with the
            themes within the story. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Process Note 1 :</strong> 
            I realized pretty quickly that the string for the warp 
            needed to be pretty tight or it wouldn't create enough
            tension to lift the alternating strings.  
            give it a little more room. 
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/w1a.jpg" alt=""></li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <strong>Process Note 2:</strong> 
           Set up was initially relatively painless. After a couple
           times rethreading the string harness, I was to create a clean 
           weave and pull through the semi conductive thread. 
            </p>
          <ul>
            <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/w1b.jpg" alt=""></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Process Note 3:</strong>
            This is where things start to go sideways... I decided I want to try to make 
            the design look like the eye that's on the cover of the book. It seemed like a 
            novel idea initially, but not being able to use the string harness for lines pulled 
            entire weave tighter than I wanted. Seemingly for nothing too, as the design wasn't 
            especially evident.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/w1c.jpg" alt=""></li>
            <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/w1d.jpg" alt=""></li>
          </ul>
          <p> 
            Here is the finished swatch, after doing some hand-weaving everything was a
            a bit tighter and not as even. So, even when using the basket weave or just 
            the string harness itself towards the end it was still messy.
          </p>

            <strong>Reflection :</strong>
             This was my first time ever weaving anything! I had a lot of fun, but even 
             as I was going through there was so many mistakes I noticed and was very tempted to
             (and occasionally did) completely unravel.

        <h3> Using the Cricket Loom </h3>
        <p id="week-two">Ana Mahadevan<br> Week Two </p>

        <p><strong>Vision :</strong>
          This week, my friend and I went on a thrifting binge
          looking for weird and interesting yarns. My plan here was
          not to make anything cohesive per say but to accomplish  
          the basics with the cricket loom, and experiment with different
          techniques and materials.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Process Note 1 :</strong> 
          The set up itself was honestly the most difficult part of this whole
          project. The precision and care that it takes just to thread the heddles
          and wind onto the warp beam was extensive. 
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/w3a.jpg" alt=""></li>
          <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/w3b.jpg" alt=""></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Process Note 2:</strong> 
         I wanted my first swatch to be a way for me to get used to
         the loom, so I experimented with how the swatch looked 
         based on how hard I would beat the wefts. You can see the variations.
          </p>
        <ul>
          <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/w3c.jpg" alt=""></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Process Note 3:</strong>
          For my next swatch, I was inspired by the area I was sitting in 
          outside with my cat. Using yarn I found that is used to 
          make sponges and dish rags, the texture and strength of the yarn
          pulled inmy warp a bit and I think ultimately made the swatches 
          different sizes. To make the clouds, I came in from the sides and 
          wove in the yarn I was using to make the headers. The contrast
          of the pokey blue threads with the soft white was very pleasing to me.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/w3d.jpg" alt=""></li>
          <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/w3e.jpg" alt=""></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Process Note 4:</strong>
          In my final swatch, I wanted to switch the methods with which
          I was weaving with. So I hand wove every other on some on the bottom
          shed, then switched for the reverse shed.
        </p>
        <p class = "fullsize"><img src="/process/ext-assets/w3f.jpg" alt=""></p>
        <p> 
          Here are the finished swatches ! Stitched off on either end to keep the 
          whole thing from unraveling
        </p>
          <p class = "fullsize"><img src="/process/ext-assets/w3final.jpg" alt=""></p>
        
          <strong>Reflection :</strong>
           I really enjoyed using the cricket loom this time. It was so much easier to 
           keep things in place and for the most part keep even tension. I do need to 
           make sure next time not to pull in the warp as much.

      <h3> Making Connectors </h3>
      <p id="week-three">Ana Mahadevan<br> Week Three </p>

      <p><strong>Vision :</strong>
        I picked up some pretty beads from the art store, and wanted to make some
        connectors that were aesthetically pleasing but still conductive and would
        be able to be somewhat modular 

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Process Note 1 :</strong> 
        I had a lot of fun making the normal kinds of connectors!
        The first one took quite a bit but after that I got into 
        a flow of sorts and it was much faster to finish the rest.
        It was a bit of a pain getting the shrink wraps over the right parts of 
        the cords and getting them to shrink down to the size they needed to be
        to fit. 
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/w2a.jpg" alt=""></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>Process Note 2:</strong> 
       I started by trying to make a more rigid connector, I twisted three strands of a 
       copper wire to weave through some of the beads but had to only thread the middle
       string for the beads which holes were smaller. I was worried this would destroy how
       conductive the connector would be but it didnt!!
        </p>
      <ul>
        <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/w2b.jpg" alt=""></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Process Note 3:</strong>
        The second connector I made requires some tension to be conductivem
        because it is less rigid. I chose to use a bra hook to connect the 
        two seperate pieces, which worked much better than I anticipated after
        some fiddling with my pliers.
      </p>

        <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/w2final.jpg" alt=""></li>
      </ul>
      
        <strong>Reflection :</strong>
         I really liked making these, and it was really intersting to
         see what different factors would change the resistance of each
         connector. I would be curious to see the actual practical 
         application of these two.

    <h3> Making A One-Bit Flipping Bead </h3>
    <p id="week-four">Ana Mahadevan<br> Week Four </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Process Note 1 :</strong> 
      I was really excited to do any kind of circuit work even if it was incredibly simple. 
      I didn't want to complicate things too much so I made two pretty simple different swatches. 
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/w4a.jpg" alt=""></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <strong> Process Note 2:</strong> 
      I wish I had thought to have a way to stick the copper wire out on two different sides in a 
      stronger way while I was weaving. I didn't realize until I was trying to put my connecters on
      the string that it made a very weak connection and therefore harder for the bead to flip.
      </p>
    <ul>
      <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/w4b.mov" alt=""></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Process Note 3:</strong>
      The first time we tried to flip the bead, it started to smoke, which of course was cause for 
      concern. I also feel like if I had sewn the bead in a little looser it would perhaps be able 
      to flip with less power needed and therefore not short when it was connected to batteries
    </p>

    </ul>
    
      <strong>Reflection :</strong>
       I had a lot of fun! I'm thinking about doing something like this again soon, 
       with the knowledge I picked up from the mistakes I made this go around.

  <h3> Dynamic Color Work </h3>
  <p id="week-five">Ana Mahadevan<br> Week Five </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Process Note 1 :</strong> 
    I started by applying thermochromic heat in two different ways. First I tied
    white string around a paper plate, then painted different strings different colors. Then for the 
    second swatch I painted the warp itself. I was curious to see what would make more of a difference
    
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/w5.jpg" alt=""></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>Process Note 2:</strong> 
   What I didnt realize, was that the thermochromic paint was going to be very
   sticky and stiff. This made weaving the coated string really difficult, but
   strangely worked perfectly for the warp. 
    </p>
  <ul>
    <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/w5.mov" alt=""></li>
  </ul>
  
    <strong>Reflection :</strong>
     This one worked really well actually! Even though the white painted strings
     was much more difficult to weave it ended up being the swatch that had a more
     obvious transition. I think i'll try this again soon.

  <h3> Multi-Shaft Album Weave </h3>
  <p id="week-eight">Ana Mahadevan<br> Week Eight </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Process Note 1 :</strong> 
    I decided to weave to two of Bjork's albums, "Debut" and "Post" which 
    are both around 45 minutes long. 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/w8.jpg" alt=""></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>Process Note 2:</strong> 
    I decided to follow a simple weave pattern in one of the books Laura gave us
    for the first couple of sections. I noticed pretty quickly that because of the 
    colors of the weft and the weave the patterns werent really that obvious at all.
    </p>

    <strong>Reflection :</strong>
    I really enjoyed this, it was calming to just listen to music and focus on the weave.
    I think moving forward I'm going to try to be a lot more intentional about the Color
    choices I make in my yarn choices.

  <h3> Documenting Final Swatch Process </h3>
  <p id="final">Ana Mahadevan<br> </p>

  <ul>
    <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/finalvision.jpg" alt=""></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>Heuristics :</strong><br>

    <strong>Contrast: </strong>
    Explore ways to emphasize the differences between materials.
    For example metallic/stark hardware to softer, feminine textures. I tried 
    to achieve this goal by creating many different swatches that juxtaposed
    these elements in unique ways.<br>
  
    <strong>Texture and Material Play: </strong>
    Experiment with different materials that reflect aesthetics from
    the runway. <br>  <br>

    <strong>Aesthetics :</strong>
    Analyze the mood board released with Sandy Liang's collection. 
    Look for key themes, colors, patterns, and textures.Creating digital
    plans that incorperate repeated elements. 
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/plan1.jpg" alt=""></li>
    <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/plan1.jpg" alt=""></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>Swatch 1 :</strong> 
    
    My very first swatch plan was made with a focus on creating a functional
    multidimensional accent. Some kind of woven element that subverts from the
    textile. I wanted it to be some what interactive, and work with a basic battery. 
    For this purpose, I chose to use my <a href='#week-three'>connectors</a> that I 
    had made for an earlier weekly. These connectors were not just physical components
    but also intentional pieces of design. 
  </p> 
  <ul>
    <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/swatch1a.jpg" alt=""></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>Process Notes :</strong> 
    I had some issues with the circuit I had intergrated staying lit. 
    I wanted to try to see if weaving in the LED itself would work alright,
    or if trying to weave in the whole circuit would be more effective. I actually
    began by trying the former, but i found that it was too easy for the connections
    to slip and I needed to solder, or create harder connections for the circuit to able to
    complete.  
  </p> 

  <ul>
    <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/swatch1b.jpg" alt=""></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>Process Note 2:</strong> 
   The swatch ended up looking like what I had planned for it to within my initial swatch 
   sketches, but there was something that was left to be desired. I felt if there was something 
   that I could do that would make this more modular, that it wouldn't just be able to light a simple 
   LED that could potentially burn out then the whole swatch would be rendered dysfunctional. aesthetically
   I appreciated it and felt asthough it met my goals. But holistically, it needed to be pushed a little further.

  <ul>
    <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/plan3.jpg" alt=""></li>
    <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/plan3.jpg" alt=""></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Swatch 2:</strong>
    The plan for this swatch was a little more abstract than the first. But I took into consideration
    that I wanted to make something that could be interchanged and potentially have multiple use cases. 
    So I began aiming to create a sort of more useable utility belt, that could bring power to a seed micro 
    controller. 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/swatch2a.png" alt=""></li>
  </ul>
  <p> 
    <strong>Process Notes:</strong>
    I spent a couple hours exploring the amount of information that could be put onto this little chip.
    On a very basic level, I wanted to make sure that I could create something that would bring power to 
    it so that the user could change and upload whatever code was the most useful to them. For purposes of
    testing and visibility I chose to run a simple blink code for this to see if the chip was getting any power, 
    and I threaded a semi conductive thread through the GND and 5V holes like wires. 

    <p class = "fullsize"><img src="/process/ext-assets/swatch2b.jpg" alt=""></p>

    I noticed that the circuit would only complete when I had some tension on the semiconductive
    thread, which seemed to make the connection stronger. I wanted to see in future iterations if there
    was a way to consider 100% of the time having a stable connection. <br><br><br><br><br>
  </p> 

  <p>
    <strong>Swatch 3:</strong><br>
    This is where things took a turn in a seemingly very different direction. This swatch ended up
    being the least technologically involved, but my favorite to create and look at. I wanted to follow
    my original emphasis of contrast and design within materials. Although it seemed the most simple, 
    because it had no electronics it actually ended up taking the most time between planning and the many,
    many, times I had to pull out all of my strings and start again. I made an insane mistake where I tried
    to 'free-loom'(?) this design before I plotted it out with the drafting worksheet from a previous class. 
    <br>
    I had pulled out the inlayed wefts six or seven times, because I had struggled to anticipate where the 
    weft needed to be to create a more rounded affect that came back around. Its much easier to have a design
    that just continously goes out. But i enjoyed making a little ribbon design out of actual ribbon.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/plan2.jpg" alt=""></li>
    <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/plan2.jpg" alt=""></li>
  </ul>

  <strong>Process Notes:</strong>
  Now that I had planned out how I wanted to weave it by drawing things out everything
  proved to be much easier after that. I would insert the ribbon in the spaces defined 
  on my draft then a line of plain tabby weave in between to keep packing more smooth. 
  The draft was quintiessential in counting and knowing where to insert the correct weave at the right
  time.

  <p class = "fullsize"><img src="/process/ext-assets/swatch3.jpg" alt=""></p>

  Despite inserting the tabby weave you can still see here how since the ribbon is much thicker than the material
  I was using for the  rest of the weaves ( same as the weft material ) it ends up making packing evenly a little 
  more difficfult. In my second swatch you see that I try to remedy this by creating several plain tabby lines
  between each weft line, which ended up spacing things out signficantly more.

  <p class = "fullsize"><img src="/process/ext-assets/swatch3a.png" alt=""></p>

  <strong>Replication Notes:</strong>
  So this inevitably was the swatch I decided I wanted to duplicate for the swatch book. Because I didn't make a defined 
  draft for the weft inlay until my second and third times around, there ended up being issues with spacing and sizing on the second iteration. In 
  hindsight , the planning probably should have come first. I feel like I could have made the swatches more similar
  if I had done it a couple more times...
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Reflection</strong>
  
  Looking back on this whole swatch making journey, I found the process of creating many different
  swatches to be really helpful in developing one consistent well rounded swatch . I had originally 
  chosen to focus on exploration of contrasting elements, whether that be in regards to cloth and 
  electronic componenets but also in materials. Even though my first four-five swatches focused on 
  more technical elements, I noticed myself gravitating towards using inlaid elementsin all of my 
  designs. This ongoing preference ended up influencing my final swatch plan. Because I felt these 
  inlaid components not only added a depth to the swatches but also became a signature aspect of 
  my work. Another little detail I really tended to like using and doing was the use of bows and 
  ribbon materials. This choice reflected my aesthetic heuristic / original inspiration from Sandy 
  Liang's collection, I felt also added a piece of personality and said something. The ribbons nod 
  to the feminine characteristics, weaving in elements of softness and fluidity. In the future, 
  I'm very excited about potentially  integrating more technology. The idea of using technological 
  components in a way that challenges the conventional appearance of tech elements is particularly 
  intriguing to me. Away with the appearance of men's engineering! I envision a future of soft connectors,
  woven not just for their strength but also for their ability to subvert expectations of what a circuit 
  typically looks like. My experiments with integrating circuits, mainly wit maintaining the circuit's 
  functionality in Swatch 1, were really helpful and informative to the following swatches. The concept of
   a modular, more resilient design became a key takeaway, especially in the context of creating textile 
   that are not only visually appealing but also practical. Swatch 2's helped explore modularity by using the 
  seeed microcontroller. Swatch 3, although technologically less involved, became a favorite of mine, because ultimately
  no matter how well something worked if I didn't find it beautiful it kind of defeated the whole aesthetic focus of my 
  heuristic. In replicating Swatch 3 for the swatch book, although there is some beauty in variation of human made, hand made 
  objects I found that I wanted more consistency and something cleaner. Overall, this journey has been a blend of artistic exploration 
  and lots and lots of technical challenges. ß
