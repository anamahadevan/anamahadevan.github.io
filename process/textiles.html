          <h3> Making a Book Loom </h3>
          <p>Ana Mahadevan<br> Week One </p>

          <p><strong>Vision :</strong>
            I got these new yarns, paper and fern silk and things,
            and I am wondering what to make with them. I’m thinking
            something to do with sound and texture. Since I had 
            some left over warp on the loom, I stared by just 
            playing with the paper yarns and seeing how they pack 
            and shape and then choosing my next step from there.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Process Note 1 :</strong> 
            I realized pretty quickly that the string for the warp 
            needed to be pretty tight or it wouldn't create enough
            tension to lift the alternating strings.  
            give it a little more room.

            <strong>Process Note 2:</strong> 
           Set up was initially relatively painless. After a couple
           times rethreading the string harness, I was to create a clean 
           weave and pull through the semi conductive thread.

          </ul>
          <p><strong>Process Note 3:</strong> Taking a step back and reflecting, I began to see the loopy ends of the paper being the most interesting. In the next steps, I played with this more:</p>
          <p><img src="/images/img_8849.jpg" alt=""></p>
          <p>At first, I though I would create patterns by interlacing the loops and allowing them to travel in different directions.</p>
          <p><img src="/images/img_8855.jpg" alt=""></p>
          <p>I then realized that the contrast between the looping paper and the brown warps created the most visual interest and I wanted to emphasize that by having more open regions of the brown.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Reflection :</strong>
             The ideas I explored didn’t lead to any magical 
             insights, but I did find that the paper might work
              best when integrated into tapestry, as a kind of
               texture. I also enjoyed the sound of working with
            the paper, making me want to explore how it could
            be designed to produce sounds more intentionally, 
            like associated with particular movements. Maybe an 
            integrated speaker might further amplify the sound.
