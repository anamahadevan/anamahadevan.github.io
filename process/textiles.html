          <h3> Making a Book Loom </h3>
          <p id="week-one">Ana Mahadevan<br> Week One </p>

          <p><strong>Vision :</strong>
            I wanted to have my weave kind of match/coincide with the book 
            I was using as my loom, not just aesthetically but also with the
            themes within the story. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Process Note 1 :</strong> 
            I realized pretty quickly that the string for the warp 
            needed to be pretty tight or it wouldn't create enough
            tension to lift the alternating strings.  
            give it a little more room. 
          </p>

            <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/w1a.jpg" alt=""></li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <strong>Process Note 2:</strong> 
           Set up was initially relatively painless. After a couple
           times rethreading the string harness, I was to create a clean 
           weave and pull through the semi conductive thread. 
            </p>
          <ul>
            <li><img src="/process/ext-assets/w1b.jpg" alt=""></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Process Note 3:</strong>
            This is where things start to go sideways... I decided I want to try to make 
            the design look like the eye that's on the cover of the book. It seemed like a 
            novel idea initially, but not being able to use the string harness for lines pulled 
            entire weave tighter than I wanted. Seemingly for nothing too, as the design wasn't 
            especially evident.

          </ul>
          <p> 
            Here is the finished swatch, after doing some hand-weaving everything was a
            a bit tighter and not as even. So, even when using the basket weave or just 
            the string harness itself towards the end it was still messy.
          </p>

            <strong>Reflection :</strong>
             This was my first time ever weaving anything! I had a lot of fun, but even 
             as I was going through there was so many mistakes I noticed and was very tempted to
             (and occasionally did) completely unravel.

        <h3> Using the Cricket Loom </h3>
        <p id=""week-three>Ana Mahadevan<br> Week Three </p>

        <p><strong>Vision :</strong>
          This week, my friend and I went on a thrifting binge
          looking for weird and interesting yarns. My plan here was
          not to make anything cohesive per say but to accomplish  
          the basics with the cricket loom, and experiment with different
          techniques and materials.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Process Note 1 :</strong> 
          The set up itself was honestly the most difficult part of this whole
          project. The precision and care that it takes just to thread the heddles
          and wind onto the warp beam was extensive.
