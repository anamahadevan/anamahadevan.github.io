In your JavaScript, label each problem using a comment (i.e., // Problem 1). Be sure your JavaScript solution to each problem outputs a final answer into the console -- that's how we'll grade each problem (e.g., Problem 1 will result in a console.log() output of the JSON you create).

Push everything to GitHub, and submit a link to the HTML page that holds the JavaScript.
